<h2>mk_org</h2>

mk_org imports ROR organisational data and adds it to a pre-existing set of organisational data focused on research and health care, with the intention of making as much as possible of that data compatible with ROR.

That data is further processed to support easier matching against organisational names in source data, and /or the selection of organisations during data input. This will include, for example, simplification of company organisational data and the addition of additional name forms for matching (as derived from sopurce data).

Currently at a very early stage of development - most code is as imported from similar projects and will need extensive revision and expansion.
